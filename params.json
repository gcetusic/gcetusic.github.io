{"name":"Goran's github page","tagline":"","body":"Goran Cetušić  |  Short bio\r\n------------- | -------------\r\n![Avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcetusic/gcetusic.github.io/master/images/avatar.jpg) | My academic and programming career started with my enrollment as a Bachelor student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb. During that time I've been involved in various activities like lecturing student courses, organizing events and projects, leading several of them as the section leader of the Electrical Engineering student club. I got my first job as a network administrator at a small firm and where I started to learn some real programming in Python. Before finishing my Bachelor studies, I got an internship position as an Openlab summer student at CERN where I worked on process accounting software for their batch cluster. After a year working as a Linux administrator and contributing to several open source projects, I'm now a dedicated Python and Django developer, juggling my responsibilities as a Masters student in Telecommunications and Informatics, currently working on my thesis on Linux network simulators and various other interests like machine learning and bioinformatics, often \"wasting\" my time on Coursera.\r\n**Education**  | <a href=\"http://www.fer.hr\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcetusic/gcetusic.github.io/master/images/fer.gif\"></a> Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecommunication and Informatics, Master studies\r\n**Contacts**  | <a href=\"mailto:goran.cetusic@gmail.com\"><img src=\"https://github.com/gcetusic/gcetusic.github.io/blob/master/images/gmail-small.png\"></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/gcetusic\"><img src=\"https://github.com/gcetusic/gcetusic.github.io/blob/master/images/octocat-icon.png\"></a>\r\n**Curiculum vitae** | https://github.com/gcetusic/gcetusic.github.io/blob/master/docs/gcetusic_en.pdf\r\n\r\n# The Programmer\r\nA Linux enthusiast every since in 2006 someone installed Ubuntu on my laptop at a yearly Linux InstallFest. Since then I've taken over the organization of the same installfest for a couple of years and even organized and lectured two Linux courses at my college. After writing (mostly) bad C code in Gedit, I've switched to Python and Komodo Edit and it's been kind to me ever since. Except for that time when Komodo Edit deleted 300 lines of code...I'm using Sublime now, with all the benefits of its lint plugins.\r\n***\r\nAfter spending some time writing more bad code and making rookie mistakes, suddenly I realized I actually have something interesting to show to other developers. Python has served me well in this but I still have a lot to learn. For example, after doing web development for a couple of years, while trying to work around badly written Django code, I've implemented my own Python metaclass, probably the most abstract thing I've done in a programming language. Here are examples of some of the projects I've worked on (for a more complete list, please view my GitHub page, some are under NDA and closed sourced)\r\n* https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-python/ - a flexible user managagement API\r\n* https://github.com/gcetusic/psacct-collector - process accounting software developed during CERN internship\r\n* https://github.com/gcetusic/IMUNES - a powerful network simulator\r\n","google":"UA-60011221-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
